    "A **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** is a widely used component in cryptographic systems to generate pseudorandom binary sequences. It consists of a shift register whose input bit is determined by a linear combination of its previous state: this combination is performed using a **feedback function**, typically encoded as a polynomial, that selects certain state bits to be XORed together and fed back into the register. The output sequence is always **periodic** and its period depends only on the structure of the LFSR. As different LFSRs can produce identical sequences, the optimal design prioritizes the shortest register length in order to reduce power consumption and area. [[2]](#references)"
